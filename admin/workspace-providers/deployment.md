This article walks you through the process of deploying a workspace provider to
a [Kubernetes cluster](../../setup/kubernetes/index.md).

[Workspace Providers](index.md) are logical groups of resources to which
developers can deploy environments. Like the Coder deployment, workspace providers
are deployed via a helm chart to the Kubernetes cluster where you'd like to
provision new environments.

## Dependencies

Install the following dependencies if you haven't already:

- [Coder CLI](../../cli/installation.md)
- [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)

## Requirements

1. Workspace providers **must have a hostname set** that is a subdomain of the
   Coder deployment. For example, if the Coder deployment's hostname is
   `coder.example.com`, the workspace provider's hostname must match the format
   `*.coder.example.com`.
2. The main Coder deployment and the workspace provider must be able to
   communicate bi-directionally via their respective hostnames.
3. The Kubernetes cluster address must be reachable from the Coder deployment.

## Connecting to the Cluster

To add a Kubernetes cluster as a workspace provider, you must first make sure
that you're connected to the cluster you want to expand into

```bash
kubectl config current-context
```

Confirm that your current kubectl context correct before continuing; otherwise,
connect to the correct context.

## Creating the Coder Namespace (Optional)

We recommend running workspace providers in a separate
[namespace](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/);
to do so, run

```bash
kubectl create namespace coder
```

Next, change the kubectl context to point to your newly created namespace:

```bash
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=coder
```

## Creating the New Workspace Provider

Using the Coder CLI, create a new workspace provider in the `pending` state.

```bash
coder providers create [NAME] \
    --hostname=[HOSTNAME] \
    --cluster-address=[CLUSTER_ADDRESS]
```

You must provide the following arguments:

- `name`: A unique name of the workspace provider
- `hostname`: Hostname of the workspace provider
- `cluster-address`: The address of the Kubernetes cluster apiserver. This can be
  retrieved using

  ```bash
  kubectl config view -o jsonpath='{.clusters[?(@.name == "'"$(kubectl config current-context)"'")].cluster.server}{"\n"}'
  ```

The `coder providers create` command will generate a helm command you will use
for the next steps, so make sure to save the output.

The returned `REMOTE_ENVPROXY_TOKEN` is a shared secret between the two
deployments and is what the workspace provider will use to authenticate itself
when communicating with the Coder deployment.

## Installing Workspace Provider

1. If you haven't already, add the Coder helm repo

   ```bash
   helm repo add coder https://helm.coder.com
   ```

1. Install the helm chart onto your cluster using helm command you generated in
   the previous step where you created the workspace provider. The helm command
   will follow this pattern:

   ```bash
   helm upgrade coder-workspace-provider coder/workspace-provider \
      --version=[CODER_VERSION] \
      --atomic \
      --install \
      --force \
      --set envproxy.token=[REMOTE_ENVPROXY_TOKEN] \
      --set ingress.host=[HOSTNAME] \
      --set envproxy.cluster-address=[CLUSTER_ADDRESS] \
      --set cemanager.accessURL=[CEMANAGER_ACCESS_URL]
   ```

   Optionally, you can provide additional helm configuration values by providing
   a `values.yaml` file and adding the argument `-f my-values.yaml` to the
   generated command. Helm values control attributes of the workspace provider,
   including DevURLs, Kubernetes storage classes, SSH, and more. See the
   [Workspace Provider Helm Chart
   Values]("https://github.com/cdr/enterprise-helm/blob/workspace-providers-envproxy-only/README.md")
   for more details.

   If you're unfamiliar with the helm configuration values file, see our doc on
   [updating a helm chart](../../guides/helm-charts.md)

2. Once the helm chart is successfully deployed, fetch the ingress address:

   ```bash
   kubectl get ingress web-ingress
   ```

   Use this IP to create a DNS record for the provided hostname of the workspace
   provider.

3. Once the Helm chart has deployed successfully, you should see the workspace
   provider in a `ready` state on the Workspace Provider Admin page.

   ![Workspace Providers Admin](../../assets/workspace-providers-admin.png)

4. From the Workspace Provider Admin page, add the desired organizations to its
   allowlist.

Users in the allowed organizations can now choose to deploy into the newly set
up workspace provider.

## Upgrading the Workspace Provider

We strongly recommend that you upgrade your workspace providers in lockstep with
your Coder deployment.

You only need to update the `--version` flag if you want to make no other helm
values changes; you can do this with

```bash
helm upgrade coder-workspace-provider coder/workspace-provider \
    --version=[CODER_VERSION] \
    --atomic \
    --install \
    --force
```

If you want to update any of the helm chart's values, you can do so by supplying
a values file (`-f myvalues.yaml`) or using with the `--set` flag. Any existing
values that were set during installation will persist unless you explicitly
write over them.

## Deleting a Workspace Provider

You can only remove a workspace provider if it no longer contains any
environments, so you must remove all environments before deleting the workspace
provider.

To remove a workspace provider, run the following command using the Coder CLI:

```bash
coder providers rm [NAME]
```
